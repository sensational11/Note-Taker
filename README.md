# Note-Taker

This challenge wanted us to demonstrate how to use express to connect the front-end/back end with starter code. The movitation behind completing this assignment is to grow our skills and knowledge as developers. I learned how to use routes and to save data on the back-end.

## Installation
The first step for installation is to download and configure node.js to work with visual studio code. The second step is downloding the express npm package. Express is what we will be using for our routes for our webpages. 

## Usage
To be able to use requires the steps outlined above and also running the command "node server.js" or "npm start". Either option works and does the same thing.
